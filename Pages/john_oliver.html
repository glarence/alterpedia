                <p><span class="emphasize">John Oliver</span> is an English comedian, political commentator, television host, and occasional actor.</p>
                <p>He's most notably known for hosting HBO's "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" and his work on "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart".</p>
                <p>Oliver has had tremendous impact with his political voice in the US, advocating moral causes and highlighting unknown and well known issues with a cheeky perspective.</p>

                    <p>Without John Oliver, there would be no "John Oliver Effect": his comedic commentary impacting US politics<ul>
                        <li>His encouragement for people to comment on the FCC's website regarding net neutrality crashed the site</li>
                        <li>Congress credits him in helping win a vote to enforce protections for chicken farmers fighting immoral industry practices</li>
                        <li>Led to 25,000 in donations after highlighting Miss America Organization and Foundation failing to back up claims of distributing scholarship money</li>
                        <li>Received mountains of donations later given to Doctors Without Borders after creating a church in order to highlight tax exemption issues</li>

                    <p>There may be no Community or The Daily Show, where John Oliver did a lot of great work as a fellow writer, correspodent, and actor</p>
