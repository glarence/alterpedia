                    <p>Streep is one of only six actors to have won three or more competitive Academy Awards for acting.</p>
                    <p>As an actress, Streep is particularly known for her chameleonic approach to her roles, transformation into the characters she plays, and her perfection of accents.</p>

                        <p>We would be without one of the best role models of consistent success.
                        Streep has in total 144 wins and 289 nominations over her illustrious career</p>
                        <p>There may not be a diverse opening of female roles without Meryl Streep,
                        who was rejected for a role in King Kong (1976), yet still continued on</p>
